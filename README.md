# Campaigns is an RPG helper
Campaigns lets you easily create and update RPG characters and track them over time.

I've deployed (some version!) of this to Azure - [check it out](http://seshbot-campaigns.azurewebsites.net/)

## Technologies
I wrote this in MVC 5/Entity Framework 6/Web API/Angular as a learning experience. Don't look to this for best practices - it's mainly a testbed for experimentation.

If you want to learn this technology, consider:
